In this project, we had to work in a group of 4 to simulate the Agile, software development process.
We worked together and set small iterations to complete this project. I, Jennifer Paul, took the 
lead and wrote the whole backend and database. Endri Shkembi set up the React framework and helped to
complete the front end.
